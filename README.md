## Overall architecture
![Overall architecture of proposed monocular pose estimation approach. Given an input image, the satellite is first detected and then the image
is cropped and resized. A random zoom-in technique is applied during training to reduce the impact of detection instability on the keypoint-set
predictor. The transformer-based keypoint-set predictor takes a fixed-size image as input and outputs the set of predefined keypoints. The pose of the
satellite is then estimated using PnP with the predefined 3-D points.](assert/revist_overall.png)

![Overall architecture of the proposed monocular pose estimation approach. Given an input image, the satellite is first cropped and resized. The
transformer-based keypoint-set predictor takes a fixed-size image as input and outputs the set of predefined keypoints and their Gaussian distributions.
The pose of the satellite is then estimated using PnP based on the 2-Dâ€“3-D correspondences. The self-assessment mechanism filters out unreliable
pose estimation results.]()
